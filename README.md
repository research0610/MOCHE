# MOCHI
Comprehensible Counterfactual Interpretation onKolmogorov-Smirnov Test

## Setup Experiment Environment

Use the following command to setup the experiment environment.

The command will install the dependencies requires by MOCHI.

```
python setup.py install
```

## Interpretation Methods

`grace.py`: The baseline method GRACE [1].

`corner_search.py`: The basline method CornerSearch [2].

`mochi.py`: Our proposed method, MOCHI.

`baselines.py`: Abstract class of interpretation methods.

## Run Experiments

Produce interpretations with the preference list generated by Bitmap [3]



```
sh bin/run_exp_bitmap.sh
```

Produce interpretations with the preference list generated by Spectral Residual [4]


```
sh bin/run_exp_spectral.sh
```

## Dataset

We use the dataset in NAB repository.
